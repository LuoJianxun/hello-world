My first gitHub program

Today is 2018-7-6, I have learned about gitHub before, but never used it. I know gitHub is a very popular tool for programmer, so I try to use it to learn more knowledge about program, like Python, Java, C++, etc. And more, I'm learning machine learning now. I hope I can become a good scholar!
